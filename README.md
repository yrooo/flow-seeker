# Flow Seeker

## Project Description

The **Flow Seeker** is a decentralized application (dApp) that revolutionizes professional networking by transforming traditional business cards into dynamic, on-chain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Built on the Lisk Layer 2 network, this project allows professionals to create a verifiable digital identity that can be shared, endorsed, and updated in real-time.

Unlike static NFTs, our business cards feature **dynamic metadata**, enabling a novel reputation system. Professionals can give and receive endorsements, which directly and transparently affect their card's on-chain reputation score. This creates a living, breathing professional profile that is both secure and reflective of a user's real-world impact.

## Key Features

- **NFT Business Cards**: Create and own a unique digital business card as an NFT.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Your card's metadata (e.g., job title, reputation score, skills) is not fixed and can be updated through on-chain transactions.
- **Reputation System**: Implement a custom endorsement module where users can endorse other professionals, affecting their public reputation score.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Your professional identity is secured by the blockchain, giving you full ownership and control.
- **Web3 Accessibility**: Built with the Lisk SDK using JavaScript and TypeScript, making it accessible to millions of developers without the need to learn new languages like Solidity.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The current version of this project represents a fully functional MVP, showcasing the core value proposition of dynamic, on-chain professional identity. The MVP includes:

- A user interface for creating and viewing a personalized NFT business card.
- The ability to mint an NFT business card to a user's Lisk wallet.
- A mechanism for other users to endorse a card holder, which updates their on-chain reputation score.
- The capability for a card owner to update specific fields of their dynamic metadata, such as their job title.
- A publicly viewable profile for each business card, displaying the key dynamic and static data.

This MVP is a solid foundation that demonstrates the project's potential to redefine professional networking in a decentralized, trustless environment.
